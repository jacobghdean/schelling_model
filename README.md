[Schelling's model of segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation) is a simulation of how agents can become separated over time based on certain characteristics (e.g. socioeconomic status). Here, I create a version of Schelling's model in Python and explore the effect of altering the different hyperparameters of the model.
